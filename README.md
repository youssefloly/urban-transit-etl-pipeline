## 📖 Overview

The **Urban Transit ETL Pipeline** is a comprehensive, production-style batch ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system designed to process large-scale urban transit open data. Developed as a capstone graduation project for the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**, this pipeline demonstrates end-to-end data engineering best practices.

The system programmatically ingests raw trip-level CSV files, performs rigorous schema validation, applies complex data cleaning and transformation logic using modern dataframe libraries (Polars/Pandas), stores intermediate artifacts in columnar formats (Apache Parquet), and securely loads the refined data into a cloud data warehouse (Google BigQuery) for analytical querying.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is designed as an educational and practical portfolio piece, built to emulate the rigor, structure, and fault-tolerance of an enterprise Data Engineering environment.

---

## ✨ Features

* **High-Performance Processing:** Utilizes `Polars` for multi-threaded, memory-efficient data transformations.
* **Strict Schema Enforcement:** Validates incoming data against pre-defined schemas to prevent pipeline contamination.
* **Resilient Data Cleaning:** Programmatic handling of missing coordinates, orphaned station IDs, and anomalous temporal data.
* **Columnar Storage Optimization:** Converts processed datasets into compressed Apache Parquet formats, reducing storage footprints and accelerating downstream reads.
* **Cloud Data Warehouse Integration:** Automated schema-mapped loading into Google BigQuery.
* **Comprehensive Analytics:** Includes pre-built SQL routines for mobility trend analysis (e.g., peak hour calculations, geographic route mapping).
* **Robust Logging & Telemetry:** JSON-formatted logs with granular trace levels for every ETL stage.
* **Orchestration Ready:** Structured to be triggered via `Cron` or seamlessly integrated into an `Apache Airflow` DAG.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Demonstrate Full Lifecycle Data Engineering:** Build an end-to-end pipeline from raw data extraction to actionable cloud-based analytics.
2. **Handle Real-World Data Anomalies:** Successfully process over 1.8 million records containing null values, missing geographical points, and diverse data types.
3. **Implement Enterprise Best Practices:** Ensure modular code architecture, strict environment separation, configuration-driven execution, and comprehensive documentation.
4. **Optimize for Scale:** Prove the viability of modern tools like Polars and Parquet over legacy row-based processing techniques.

---

## 🚀 Usage

The pipeline can be executed entirely via the command line or run modularly.

### Configuration

Before running the pipeline, set up your configuration. Copy the template configuration file:

```bash
cp config/config.template.yaml config/config.yaml

```

Edit `config/config.yaml` to include your GCP project details:

```yaml
gcp:
  project_id: "your-gcp-project-id"
  dataset_id: "urban_transit_dw"
  table_id: "citi_bike_trips_202401"
  credentials_path: "/path/to/your/service-account.json"

pipeline:
  raw_data_dir: "data/raw"
  parquet_dir: "data/parquet"
  batch_size: 100000

```

### Running the Pipeline

Execute the master orchestrator script:

```bash
python src/main.py --config config/config.yaml

```

To run individual modules (useful for debugging):

```bash
# Run only validation and cleaning
python src/cleaning/clean_data.py --input data/raw --output data/processed

# Run Parquet conversion
python src/parquet/convert.py --input data/processed --output data/parquet

```

## 🧩 Pipeline Modules

A deep dive into the engineering logic behind each pipeline stage.

### 1. Data Ingestion

Reads multiple large CSV files efficiently. Instead of loading the entire 1.8M rows into RAM simultaneously, the ingestion module utilizes `polars.scan_csv()` for lazy evaluation, generating an optimized query plan before execution.

### 2. Schema Validation

Checks the structure of the incoming data against a defined schema contract.

* Validates that `ride_id` is a string of expected length.
* Ensures `started_at` and `ended_at` can be cast to `datetime`.
* Rejects or quarantines files that add unexpected columns or change delimiters.

### 3. Data Cleaning

Addresses the missing values identified in the profiling stage:

* **Geo-Coordinates:** Missing `end_lat` and `end_lng` (5,486 rows) are isolated. Since geographical tracking is critical, these rows are flagged and stored in a separate `data_quality_issues` table rather than dropped, preserving the trip duration metric.
* **Station IDs:** Standardizes formatting inconsistencies in `start_station_id` (1,160 missing).
* **Deduplication:** Confirms 0 duplicate `ride_id`s, ensuring transactional integrity.

### 4. Data Transformation

Applies complex business logic to prepare the data for analytics:

* **Derived Columns:** Calculates `trip_duration_minutes` (Difference between `ended_at` and `started_at`).
* **Temporal Features:** Extracts `day_of_week`, `hour_of_day`, and `is_weekend` to support peak-hour analytics.
* **Distance Calculation:** Applies the Haversine formula on latitude/longitude columns to estimate `straight_line_distance_km`.

### 5. Post Validation

Runs statistical assertions post-transformation:

* Asserts `trip_duration_minutes` > 0.
* Asserts `started_at` <= `ended_at`.

### 6. Apache Parquet Conversion

Converts the memory representation into an Apache Parquet format using PyArrow.

* **Partitioning:** Data is partitioned by `started_at` (Date).
* **Compression:** Snappy compression is applied, reducing the file size by approximately 75% compared to raw CSVs while drastically speeding up BigQuery ingestion.

---

## ☁️ BigQuery Integration

The processed Parquet files are loaded into Google BigQuery using the `google-cloud-bigquery` library.

**Load Strategy Strategy:** `WRITE_TRUNCATE` (for idempotency during backfills) or `WRITE_APPEND` (for daily batching).

**Schema Auto-Detection:** The pipeline leverages Parquet's strict schema definitions to automatically create and map BigQuery table structures without manual DDL intervention.

---

## 📈 SQL Analytics

Once the data is warehoused in BigQuery, analytical views are created to serve Business Intelligence dashboards.

```sql
-- sql/analytics/peak_hours.sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) AS hour_of_day,
    member_casual,
    COUNT(ride_id) AS total_rides,
    ROUND(AVG(trip_duration_minutes), 2) AS avg_duration_minutes
FROM 
    `your-project.urban_transit_dw.citi_bike_trips_202401`
GROUP BY 
    hour_of_day, member_casual
ORDER BY 
    total_rides DESC;

```

```sql
-- sql/analytics/popular_routes.sql
SELECT 
    start_station_name,
    end_station_name,
    COUNT(ride_id) AS route_volume
FROM 
    `your-project.urban_transit_dw.citi_bike_trips_202401`
WHERE 
    start_station_name IS NOT NULL 
    AND end_station_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    start_station_name, end_station_name
ORDER BY 
    route_volume DESC
LIMIT 10;

```

---

## ⚙️ Automation & Orchestration

To transform this from a simple script to an enterprise pipeline, execution is automated.

* **Cron:** For lightweight environments, `src/scheduler/cron_job.sh` wraps the pipeline in a shell script that can be executed nightly.
* **Apache Airflow:** For full-scale deployments, the `src/scheduler/transit_dag.py` defines a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) handling retries, dependency mapping, and failure alerts via email.

---

## 📝 Logging & Monitoring

### Logging

The `src/utils/logger.py` module outputs machine-readable JSON logs for ingestion into systems like ELK or Datadog, alongside human-readable console outputs.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-06-29T03:14:55.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "module": "transformation",
  "message": "Successfully calculated trip_duration_minutes for 1,888,085 rows.",
  "duration_ms": 1420
}

```

### Monitoring

Post-validation scripts act as data quality monitors. If missing values exceed a configurable threshold (e.g., > 1% of the daily batch), the pipeline throws a `DataQualityException` and halts BigQuery insertion.

---
